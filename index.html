   Greetings! My name is Dom. I was born in Philadelphia, PA on October 12th, 1990. I lived in the northwestern section of the city, Chestnut Hill, until I graduated high school in 2008. 
   I went to college at American University in Washington, DC, where I studied International Affairs for 4 years. Always having a love for learning new languages and cultures, I studied abroad for a year in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil between 2010 and 2011.</br>
   <br>
    Upon returning from Rio, I graduated college and moved to New York City. In New York I worked as a Creative Project Manager, aiding teams of graphic designers, coders, and marketers in developing successful marketing campaigns.</br>
    <br>
    In 2018 I decided to take break from New York's fast-pace lifestyle, and I embarked on a journey to teach English at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz in the small city of Ilh√©us, Brazil. 
   My return to Brazil enabled me to enhance my Portuguese skills and further explore my interest in Latin American history and literature.<br>
   <br>
    I finally returned to the States in 2019 and I'm now looking to rejoin the corporate world as a Web Developer.<br>
   <br>
    When I'm not working or traveling you can catch me reading a book or watching a movie about a remote area of the world. You'll also find me lost at thought drawling or playing videogames (Resident Evil 2 Remake was so good!).<br>
